# Introduction
Many areas far from the city center face difficulty in accessing pharmacies, especially in the case of the need for medicines in the evening and the non-availability of pharmacies on duty next to them. 
So we decided to build a website to help the pharmacy owner to display the medicines available in his pharmacy on the website and to help people request medical prescriptions through it.


# Project Features
* At the beggining our website have two levels of user (Admin and Normal User).
* Once the website is accessed by the normal user, the user would be redirected to the home page of our website where there is an option to register or login.  
* Normal user has many features, such as every user can create his own account and then login in order to have a full accessibility to our website to see all mediciens in the website.
* The admin only can add, delete, and edit his medicine to sell it by providing information and image to another user. When user makes an order, a request message will be sent to the admin either to accept ot reject it.
* The user has the ability to provide the admin with a specific feedback.
* Each user has his own cart to add as many medicines that he wants, and then he can send his order to the admin either to accpect or reject it. 
* Finally we divide medicines in categories to help people to choose from specific category.
