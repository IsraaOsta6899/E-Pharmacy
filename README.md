# Introduction
Many areas far from the city center face difficulty in accessing pharmacies, especially in the case of the need for medicines in the evening and the non-availability of pharmacies on duty next to them. 
So we decided to build a website to help the pharmacy owner to display the medicines available in his pharmacy on the website and to help people request medical prescriptions through it.


# Project Features
At the beggining our website have two levels of user (Admin  , Normal User)
Normal user features , every user can create his own account and login to see all mediciens in the website.
The admin only can add, delete, and edit his medicine to sell it by providing information and image to another user. When user makes an order, a request message will be sent to the admin either to accept ot reject it.
The user has the ability to provide the admin with a specific feedback.
Each user has his own cart to add as many medicines that he wants, and then he can send his order to the admin either to accpect or reject it. 
Finally we divide medicines in categories to help people to choose from specific category.
